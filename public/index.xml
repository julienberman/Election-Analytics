      <description>Last week, I finally completed the full extent of my model architecture! We have now incorporated most of the data that we will use in our final model, multiple layers of prediction using an elastic net regression with optimized parameters, and model ensembling. Three items are on our agenda for this week. First, I will fix a few lingering errors that I noticed in last weekâ€™s model. Then, I will build a visualization for my 2024 election predictions.</description>

      <title>Blog Post 4: Model Improvements</title>

      <description>Overview This week, I plan to take a step back and fully refine and optimize my model that I have created over the past few weeks. I will only include a single new source of already clean data &amp;mdash; the Cook Political Report expert ratings &amp;mdash; which means that I plan to devote the full post to code and methodological improvements.&#xA;As a reminder, my current model proceeds in three steps.</description>

      <description>Overview Last week, I developed a comprehensive structure that can be used to build a model that combines the fundamentals with a current snapshot of the political climate in order to forecast the electoral college. The model proceeded in three steps:&#xA;Forecast each state&amp;rsquo;s elasticity, which represents the change in state-level vote margin between two election cycles. This metric measures the &amp;ldquo;swinginess&amp;rdquo; of a state. Forecast each state&amp;rsquo;s partisan lean, which measures the extent to which a state is either more democratic or more republican than the national popular vote.</description>

      <description>Overview This week, I will expand the predictive model for the 2024 presidential election that I developed last week. In my previous model, I used the &amp;ldquo;partisan lean index&amp;rdquo; (PLI) &amp;mdash; which measures the difference between the state&amp;rsquo;s democratic two-party vote share and the two party democratic vote share nationwide, and includes adjustments for home state advantage and state-level population density &amp;mdash; in the previous two election cycles to predict the electoral college results for the current election cycle.</description>

      <title>Blog Post 1: Historical Election Data</title>
      <link>https://example.org/post/2024/09/05/blog-post-1/</link>

      <description>In this first blog post, I will analyze and visualize historical presidential election data in order to better understand trends in the electoral college and develop a naive predictive model for the 2024 election. I will complete extension 1 as some exploratory analysis of my own.&#xA;Electoral College Timeline Below I have produced two electoral college maps for the previous presidential elections from 1948 to 2020. The following interactive map plots the electoral college results for each election at the state level:</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
