      <description>In this first blog post, I will analyze and visualize historical presidential election data in order to better understand trends in the electoral college and develop a naive predictive model for the 2024 election. I will complete extensions 1 and 3 as well as some exploratory analysis of my own.&#xA;Electoral College Timeline Below I have produced two electoral college maps for the previous presidential elections from 1948 to 2020.</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
