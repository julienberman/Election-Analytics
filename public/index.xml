      <description>This assignment is ungraded and is simply intended to give you a sense of what we will be doing in class and to be sure you have all the tools in place to successfully complete your blog posts. Whereas most of the programming you will do in this course is very open-ended, this assignment is designed to walk you step-by-step through some helpful functions. You should complete this assignment after you have successfully installed R/R Studio and set up your blog on GitHub.</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
