      <description>\(SE = \sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}\)&#xA;This week, I will expand the predictive model for the 2024 presidential election that I developed last week. In my previous model, I used the &amp;ldquo;partisan lean index&amp;rdquo; (PLI) &amp;mdash; which measures the difference between the state&amp;rsquo;s democratic two-party vote share and the two party democratic vote share nationwide, and includes adjustments for home state advantage and state-level population density &amp;mdash; in the previous two election cycles to predict the electoral college results for the current election cycle.</description>

The following interactive map plots the electoral college results for each election at the state level:</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
